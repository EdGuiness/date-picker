date-picker
===========

Chrome date picker extension

This extension adds a calendar to any web page. 

Activate the date picker by double-clicking in a text field, then click on a date to select it into the text field.

Alternatively click on the date picker icon in the extensions panel then click on a date to copy it to the clipboard.

If it doesn't work for you please let me know so I can improve it. You can find me on twitter as @KiwiCoder.
